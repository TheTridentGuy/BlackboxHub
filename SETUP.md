# Setup Steps:

- Follow instructions [here](https://github.com/morrownr/8821cu-20210916) to set up wifi adapter drivers.
- Use [this](https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/raspberry-pi-access-point) guide to set the pi up as an access point. **MAKE SURE THAT YOU USE `wlan1` FOR THE AP, OTHERWISE YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO CONNECT HEADLESSLY**
